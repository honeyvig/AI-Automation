    AI & Automation Development: Using APIs and low-code automation tools.
    Marketing Automation: Integrating Go High Level or other CRMs.
    Process Improvement: Automating lead qualification and customer communication.
    System Integration: Ensuring API connections with different platforms.

Step-by-Step Python Code Approach
1. Automating Lead Management in Go High Level

To interact with Go High Level (GHL) CRM and automate lead management workflows, you can use GHL’s API (or a third-party tool like Zapier or Make) to perform actions like lead creation, task management, and communication follow-ups. Below is an example Python code for automating lead creation and follow-ups.

Dependencies:

pip install requests

Python Code Example for Go High Level API Integration:

import requests
import json

# Go High Level API endpoint and your API Key
API_KEY = 'your_go_high_level_api_key'
BASE_URL = 'https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1'

# Create Lead in Go High Level CRM
def create_lead(first_name, last_name, email, phone):
    url = f'{BASE_URL}/contacts'
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    lead_data = {
        "first_name": first_name,
        "last_name": last_name,
        "email": email,
        "phone": phone
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=lead_data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Lead Created Successfully!")
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to Create Lead: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Follow-up automation via email (simplified)
def send_email_follow_up(lead_id, email_subject, email_body):
    url = f'{BASE_URL}/emails'
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    email_data = {
        "contact_id": lead_id,
        "subject": email_subject,
        "body": email_body
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=email_data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Follow-up Email Sent Successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to Send Email: {response.status_code}")

# Example Usage
new_lead = create_lead("John", "Doe", "johndoe@example.com", "+123456789")
if new_lead:
    lead_id = new_lead['id']
    send_email_follow_up(lead_id, "Thanks for Contacting Us!", "We appreciate your interest in our services. We'll get back to you soon.")

This code allows you to create a new lead in Go High Level CRM and automatically send a follow-up email.
2. AI & Automation Development with OpenAI Integration

You can create AI-driven tools like chatbots using OpenAI's API, and then integrate those into your business processes. For example, creating a simple chatbot to handle customer queries related to your services.

Dependencies:

pip install openai

Python Code Example for Integrating OpenAI API (Chatbot):

import openai

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# Function to interact with OpenAI (GPT-3)
def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # GPT-3 model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example Usage - AI-based chatbot interaction
user_input = "What is your service about?"
bot_response = generate_response(user_input)
print(f"Chatbot Response: {bot_response}")

This will provide automated responses based on user input, and you can integrate it into your CRM workflow for customer communication.
3. Marketing Automation and Workflow Optimization

You can use low-code tools like Zapier or Make to integrate with platforms like Google Sheets, Slack, or Gmail for task automation and communication. Below is an example of how you could set up a workflow to automatically update your Google Sheets and send notifications when a new lead is added.

Dependencies:

pip install gspread oauth2client

Python Code Example for Google Sheets Integration (Low-Code Workflow Automation):

import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials
from datetime import datetime

# Google Sheets API Credentials
scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"]
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('your_credentials.json', scope)
client = gspread.authorize(creds)

# Google Sheets Worksheet
spreadsheet = client.open("Lead Tracker").sheet1

# Function to update Google Sheet with new lead
def update_google_sheet(lead_name, lead_email, lead_phone):
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    new_lead = [current_time, lead_name, lead_email, lead_phone]
    
    # Insert new lead data in the first empty row
    spreadsheet.append_row(new_lead)
    print(f"Lead {lead_name} added to Google Sheets!")

# Example Usage
update_google_sheet("Jane Doe", "janedoe@example.com", "+987654321")

This example updates a Google Sheet with new lead data (name, email, phone), which can be used as part of your marketing automation workflow.
4. Process Improvement and AI-Driven Solutions

To implement AI-driven solutions for business processes like lead qualification and sales enablement, you can use machine learning to automatically score leads based on certain criteria. Below is a simplified example of how to use a basic model (e.g., decision trees or random forests) to classify leads.

Dependencies:

pip install scikit-learn

Python Code Example for Lead Scoring with ML:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data for lead scoring
data = {
    'lead_score': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # 1=qualified, 0=unqualified
    'interest_level': [7, 8, 3, 9, 2],  # Scale of 1-10
    'budget': [10000, 15000, 3000, 12000, 2000],  # Budget in USD
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Feature columns
X = df[['interest_level', 'budget']]
y = df['lead_score']

# Train a random forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predicting for a new lead
new_lead = np.array([[8, 11000]])  # interest level = 8, budget = 11000
predicted_score = model.predict(new_lead)
print(f"Predicted Lead Qualification Score: {predicted_score[0]}")

This example uses machine learning to predict whether a lead is qualified based on interest level and budget.
Conclusion

With these Python code examples, we address various aspects of the job, including:

    AI Integration: OpenAI-powered chatbots for customer interaction.
    Marketing Automation: Go High Level CRM integration for lead management and follow-ups.
    Process Improvement: Machine learning models for lead scoring and classification.
    System Integration: Google Sheets for automated lead tracking and management.

This approach can be extended to other platforms, CRMs, and APIs based on your specific business needs. Each script can be further customized and optimized to fit your requirements and automation workflows.
